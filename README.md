# Hangman-game
Classic hangman game that picks a random word from a text file for user to guess

This project focuses on creating a text file filled with random words and loading those words into an array.
*NOTE* In order for this game to work, you must store the csv file into the "C:\Intel" folder and remove when finished

* Purpose: To create a "hangman" game that picks a random word from a text file of words that then requests the user to guess each letter of the word. 
* 
* Input: User input of a letter to guess each letter of the word
* 
* Process: When the user makes a correct guess, the actual letter is then displayed. When the user finishes a word, it will display the number of misses and asks the user whether to continue to play with another word.
* 
* Output: If the user makes a correct guess, the actual letter is displayed, if not it remains as an asterisk until the user guesses correctly. Once word is correctly guessed, it will prompt user to play again or not.
